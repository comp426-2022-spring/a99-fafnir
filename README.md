# Personal Health Information Management App (Clock Eats)

## Summary 

Planning and development for an application centered around tracking personal health information while performing useful calculations and curating summaries of the user's nutrition, activity level, and sleep patterns.

## How to Use

If you have not used our application previously, use "npm install" in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies. 

To begin running the application, type "npm start" or "node server.js" in the terminal.

To begin logging data, first create a profile under the "Create profile" tab. If you are a returning user, you may simply use the "Profile" tab and log in using your username and password. The "Log In" tab for authentication is not currently functional.

If you would like to add data, use the "Add sleep" tab and use the dropdown menu to choose your wakeup time, bedtime, and meal times. Once submitting this data, it will contribute to your data summary and sleep score on the "Home" page.

If you would like to access your summary and sleep score, click on the "Home" tab and select the "Get sleep score" or "Get sleep summary" buttons. Note, if you have not included data for some of these fields, the averages will reflect this. Thus, it's best to always fill out each section on the "Add sleep" page for the most accurate results. As more data is collected, the averages and sleep score will show a more accurate depiction of your sleeping habits.
